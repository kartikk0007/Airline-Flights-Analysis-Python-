# Airline-Flights-Analysis-Python-
This project involves an end-to-end data analysis workflow, focusing on a real-world structured dataset containing flights booking details. Utilizing core Python libraries, this analysis explores operational trends, price variations, and customer booking behaviors within the Indian aviation domain

# Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze a comprehensive flights booking dataset to uncover actionable insights regarding pricing strategies, operational logistics, and the factors influencing ticket costs, which is highly relevant for those working in the airlines, travel, or aviation domains.

# Tools & Techonology 
The entire analysis was performed in a Jupyter notebook environment, leveraging essential Python data science libraries:

Pandas (pd): Used extensively for data manipulation, cleaning (removing the unnecessary index column), statistical summaries (describe()), filtering, and grouping data (groupby).


NumPy (np): Imported for numerical operations.


Matplotlib (plt): Used to create various visualizations, including bar graphs and subplots, to show frequencies of airlines and flight timings.


Seaborn (sns): Utilized for drawing advanced categorical plots (catplot) and relational plots (relplot) to analyze price variations across airlines, classes, and cities
